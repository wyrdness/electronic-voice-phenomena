## Overview

Electronic Voice Phenomena (EVP) is the claimed communication with spirits through electronic audio recordings. Practitioners record in allegedly haunted locations using digital recorders or specialized equipment, then play back recordings searching for "voices" in background noise or static that were not heard during the original recording.

The practice developed in the 1950s-1960s, notably by Friedrich Jürgenson (1959) and Konstantin Raudive (who claimed over 100,000 recordings). Modern ghost hunting has popularized "spirit boxes" (radio frequency scanners) and EVP remains a core technique despite scientific consensus attributing the phenomenon to **pareidolia** (hearing patterns in noise) and **radio interference**.

| Name | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| Raudive Voices | Named after researcher Konstantin Raudive |

## EVP Classification System

### Three Classes by Clarity

| Class | Description | Clarity | Frequency |
|-------|-------------|---------|-----------|
| **Class A** | Clear, easily understood by all listeners without prompting | High | Very rare |
| **Class B** | Moderately clear, most agree with some prompting | Medium | Occasional |
| **Class C** | Unclear, heavy interpretation required, listeners often disagree | Low | Very common |

**Note**: The vast majority of claimed EVP are Class C, requiring significant interpretation and prompting.

## Recording Methods

### Equipment & Techniques

| Method | Description | Usage | Notes |
|--------|-------------|-------|-------|
| **Digital voice recorder** | Standard digital recorders left in location | Most common | Basic EVP method |
| **Spirit box** | Radio frequency scanner rapidly sweeping stations | Common in ghost hunting | Controversial; picks up random radio fragments |
| **Tape recorder** (historical) | Original method using analog tape | Rare (outdated) | Used 1950s-1980s |
| **Specialized EVP equipment** | Custom devices for spirit communication | Occasional | Various experimental designs |

### Typical Process

1. Enter allegedly haunted location
2. Start recording device
3. Ask questions directed at spirits
4. Leave recorder running
5. Play back audio, listening for "responses"
6. Interpret unclear sounds as words/messages

---

## Typical EVP Content

Common characteristics of claimed EVP:
- Single words or short phrases
- Names of living or deceased persons
- Apparent responses to questions asked during recording
- Unclear sounds interpreted as words
- Background conversations (often from radio interference)

## Historical Timeline

### Origins

Developed in mid-20th century as technology became accessible. Combines spiritualism tradition (desire to communicate with the dead) with modern electronic recording technology.

### Key Events

| Date | Event | Significance |
|------|-------|--------------|
| 1959 | Friedrich Jürgenson first recordings | Swedish filmmaker discovers unexplained voices on bird song recordings |
| 1965 | Konstantin Raudive begins research | Latvian psychologist conducts extensive EVP experiments |
| 1971 | Raudive's *Breakthrough* published in English | Brings EVP to wider audience |
| 1970s | Scientific testing by Pye Records | No convincing evidence found in controlled conditions |
| 2000s | Ghost hunting TV popularization | Shows like *Ghost Adventures*, *Ghost Hunters* make EVP mainstream |

## Notable Research & Evidence

### Raudive Voices (1965-1974)

**Researcher**: Konstantin Raudive (Latvian psychologist)

**Claim**: Over 100,000 recordings of spirit voices

**Scientific Testing**: 
- Pye Records (professional audio company) tested Raudive's claims in 1970s
- Controlled conditions with engineers and scientists
- **Result**: No convincing evidence of paranormal voices
- **Conclusion**: Radio interference and pareidolia (hearing patterns in noise)

**Credibility**: Disputed — Scientific testing found mundane explanations

---

### Jürgenson Recordings (1959)

**Background**: Swedish filmmaker Friedrich Jürgenson accidentally recorded unexplained voices while taping bird songs in 1959

**Significance**: Pioneered EVP field, inspired later researchers

**Analysis**: No scientific verification; likely radio interference and misinterpretation of natural sounds

---

## Scientific Analysis & Explanations

### Pareidolia (Audio) — Primary Explanation

**Definition**: Human brain's tendency to find patterns in random noise

**How it applies to EVP**:
- Random static/noise sounds like words when we listen for them
- Expectation creates perception
- Different listeners hear different "words" in same recording
- Well-established psychological phenomenon

**Evidence**:
- Backmasking demonstrations (hearing "hidden messages" in reversed music)
- Controlled experiments show strong expectation effects
- Without prompting, listeners rarely agree on "words"

---

### Radio Interference — Technical Explanation

**Description**: Electronic devices pick up stray radio signals

**Sources**:
- AM/FM radio broadcasts
- CB radios
- Walkie-talkies
- Cell phone signals
- Other electronic devices

**Evidence**:
- Spirit boxes literally scan radio frequencies
- Known RF interference in electronic equipment
- Controlled environments (Faraday cages) eliminate "voices"

---

### Confirmation Bias

**Definition**: Finding what you expect to find

**How it applies**:
- Investigators expect to hear spirits
- Interpret ambiguous sounds as desired messages
- Remember "hits," forget "misses"
- Prompting dramatically affects what listeners report hearing

---

### Audio Artifacts

**Technical Issues**:
- Digital compression artifacts
- Electrical interference
- Equipment noise
- Microphone sensitivity picking up distant sounds

---

## Cultural Significance

### Modern Ghost Hunting

EVP is **fundamental technique** in paranormal investigation:
- Featured on virtually all ghost hunting TV shows
- Considered "evidence" by paranormal community
- Various equipment marketed for EVP recording
- Smartphone apps claiming EVP capability

### Popular Culture

**Television**:
- *Ghost Adventures* (2008-present) — Heavy EVP use
- *Ghost Hunters* (2004-2016, 2019-present) — Regular EVP segments
- *Paranormal State* (2007-2011) — EVP evidence

**Film**:
- *White Noise* (2005) — Film about EVP
- *The Conjuring* (2013) — EVP recordings depicted

**Impact**: TV shows have made EVP one of the most recognized paranormal investigation techniques

## Critical Perspective

### Why EVP Is Not Spirit Communication

1. **Pareidolia is well-established** — We hear patterns in noise; it's how human perception works
2. **Radio interference is common** — Electronic devices pick up stray signals constantly
3. **No verification possible** — "Spirit" never says anything verifiable
4. **Controlled tests fail** — Scientific testing eliminates "voices"
5. **Highly subjective** — Listeners disagree on what "words" they hear
6. **Spirit boxes are radios** — Literally scanning radio frequencies, picking up fragments
7. **Expectation drives perception** — Prompting dramatically changes what people "hear"

### Scientific Consensus

**No evidence of spirit communication**. EVP is explained by:
- Audio pareidolia
- Radio interference
- Confirmation bias
- Technical artifacts
- Psychological expectation effects

## Research & Investigation

### Historical Researchers

| Name | Background | Contribution | Period |
|------|------------|--------------|--------|
| Friedrich Jürgenson | Swedish filmmaker | First documented EVP recordings | 1959-1987 |
| Konstantin Raudive | Latvian psychologist | Extensive research, claimed 100,000+ recordings | 1965-1974 |

### Scientific Testing

**Key Finding**: Controlled scientific tests consistently fail to find evidence of paranormal voices

**Methodological Issues in EVP Research**:
- Lack of controls
- No blinding (researchers know what to expect)
- Selection bias (only "interesting" recordings published)
- No repeatability
- No verification possible
