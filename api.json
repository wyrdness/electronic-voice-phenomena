      "full": "Electronic Voice Phenomena (EVP) is the claimed communication with spirits through electronic audio recordings. Practitioners record in allegedly haunted locations using digital recorders or specialized equipment, then play back recordings searching for \\\"voices\\\" in background noise or static that were not heard during the original recording. The practice developed in the 1950s-1960s, notably by Friedrich Jürgenson (1959) and Konstantin Raudive (who claimed over 100,000 recordings). Modern ghost hunting has popularized \\\"spirit boxes\\\" (radio frequency scanners) and EVP remains a core technique despite scientific consensus attributing the phenomenon to **pareidolia** (hearing patterns in noise) and **radio interference**."
