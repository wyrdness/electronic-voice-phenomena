      "summary": "Claimed communication with spirits via electronic recordings. Practitioners record in allegedly haunted locations, then play back recordings searching for 'voices' in static or noise that were not audible during recording.",
      "full": "Electronic Voice Phenomena (EVP) is the claimed communication with spirits through electronic audio recordings. The method involves recording in allegedly haunted locations using digital recorders or specialized equipment, then playing back the recording to find 'voices' in background noise or static that were not heard during the original recording. The practice developed in the 1950s-1960s, notably by Friedrich Jürgenson (1959) and Konstantin Raudive (who claimed over 100,000 recordings). EVP is classified by clarity: Class A (clear, all listeners hear), Class B (some interpretation needed), Class C (heavy interpretation required). Modern ghost hunting popularized 'spirit boxes' (radio frequency scanners). Scientific consensus attributes EVP to pareidolia (hearing patterns in noise) and radio interference, with no verified spirit communication. Despite scientific explanation, EVP remains popular in paranormal investigation and appears regularly on ghost hunting television programs."
